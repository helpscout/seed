## Documentation

You can find all of our documentation at **[https://seedcss.com](http://developer.helpscout.net/seed/)**.


## About this repo

This [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md) contains all the official Seed Packs that make up the foundations of Seed CSS. The idea for the monorepo was inspired by [IstanbulJS](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs).

Having an all-in-one repo allows easier coordination and maintanence.

And having to do a single git clone is way _way_ nicer than having to do 60+ git clones üòú.


### Impact on Seed Packs

No worries! All of the Seed Packs can still be individually installed via `npm install`. That's not goin' away. The Packs are just moving to a new home on Github is all.
